A module to support **OGC geopackage** with sqlite.

At the moment 3857 tiles in google schema and proj4 compatible vector (features) tables are supported.

This uses [moor_ffi](https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite3) to handle sqlite, since it supports functions.
Earlier version used to use sqflite.

**View the example README for instructions on how to integrate it in an app.**
